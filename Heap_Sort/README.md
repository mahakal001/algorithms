# Heap Sort Implementation ( along with  heap implementation ) 
The (binary) heap data structure is an array object that we can view as a nearly complete binary tree . 
Each node of the tree corresponds to an element of the array. The tree is completely  filled on all levels 
except possibly the lowest, which is filled from the left up to a point. 
An array A that represents a heap is an object with two attributes: 
        A:length, which (as usual) gives the number of elements in the array, and
        A:heap-size, which represents how many elements in the heap are stored within array A.
